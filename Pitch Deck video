The Goal of this project was to analyze YouTube Data to derive actionable insights for designing effective advertisings on this platform.

Companies have trouble targeting ads, making them relevant, and knowing their business value on YouTube. 
Our engineering solutions use YouTube data in new ways to reach the right people, run winning campaigns, and clearly prove marketing ROI.

We transform wasted YouTube ad spend into real business outcomes - more revenue, more conversions, and happier customers finding products they want.
